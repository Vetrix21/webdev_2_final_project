          <ul>
            <li><strong>Where do you operate?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">Our services expand across all of Illinois. We are hoping soon to branch into neighboring states, such as Wisconsin and Indiana as well.</li>
            <li><strong>What times are you available to move?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">How much can I store with your services?</li>
            <li><strong>Do I need to prepare anything before you show up?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">That depends on the job, but typically no. A cleared space between the item(s) you want moved and your door would be nice, but we can take care of that as well.</li>
            <li><strong>How many people can I expect?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">Again, that depends on the job. Typically, our teams consist of 2-3 pople, but if your job is especially demanding or expedited we can provide more as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Do I need to buy my own boxes?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">We offer boxes as part of our service, for a small charge depending on the type of boxes desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Can you help me move out of state?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">So long as the initial job destination is in Illinois, and the drive is no longer than 10 hours to the next location, we can assist you in moving cross-state.</li>
            <li><strong>How fast are your jobs?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">Depends on the job, but we aim for speed and efficiency. Expect anywhere from 1-5 hours, or if you have more things to move or are moving houses 5-10 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Can I stay home while you work?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">Of course! We take any measures necesary to ensure we do not intrude on the living spaces of our clients.</li>
            <li><strong>How much should I expect to pay?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer">We try to be affordable as much as we can. Our hourly rate is $75, though for certain jobs transportation fees may also apply.</li>
            <li><strong>How can I contact you?</strong></li>
            <li class="answer"><a href="contact.html">You can reach us here, through this website!</a></li>
